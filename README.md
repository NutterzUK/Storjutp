# File Transfer by [libutp](https://github.com/bittorrent/libutp)

This module transfers files by [libutp](https://github.com/bittorrent/libutp).
libutp uses [LEDBAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEDBAT) technology, 
which does not interrupt other works that uses network, like web browsing,
downloading, etc, i.e. Storjutp transfer files in _background_.

    $ git submodule update --recursive --init
    $ make test
    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libtap ./test

To run the associated tests for python:

    $ python setup.py test -a "--doctest-modules --pep8 -v tests/ storjutp/"

for Windows OS, [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) must be installed first.
